Installation Guide
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For now, xLearn can support Linux and Mac OSX. We will support Windows in the future.
This page gives instructions on how to build and install the xLearn package from 
source code or using pip. Whatever way you choose, make sure that your OS has already 
installed GCC (or Clang) and CMake.

Install GCC or Clang
---------------------------

If you have already installed your compiler before, you can skip this step.

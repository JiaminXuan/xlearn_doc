Large-Scale Machine Learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This page shows how to use xLearn to solve large-scale machine learning problems. 
In recent years, challenges arise with the fast-growing data. For "big-data", we focus
on datasets with potentially trillions of training examples, which cannot fit in the 
memory of a single machine. Motivated by this, we design xLearn to solve large-scale 
machine learning problems. First, xLearn can handle very large data (TB) on a single PC 
by using *out-of-core* training. In addition, xLearn can scale beyond billions of example
across many machines to support distributed training by using the *parameter server* framework.
